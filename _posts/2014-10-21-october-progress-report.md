<p class="lead">We&rsquo;ve been working hard on the backend code for the new website and things are progressing nicely. Meanwhile, we&rsquo;re going to start here.</p>

<p>The short story is we&rsquo;ve been working around a lot of people&rsquo;s schedules to get things done with the new website. It&rsquo;s a challenge we hadn&rsquo;t anticipated and it has slowed things down a little.</p>
<p>However, the team is <a href="https://github.com/AWDG/awdg">making good progress</a>. So while they get the guts of the new CMS and administration systems up and running, we figured we'd go ahead and start using this site to post event information and show <a href="#sponsors">our wonderful sponsors</a> some love.</p>
<h3>Testing Events Pages</h3>
<p>Now you can see a list of all the <a href="/events/">upcoming events</a> and get details about each one. The RSVP links still go to Meetup for now. As soon as we get our payment mechanism up and running that will be changing, too.</p>
<p><strong><em>These  aren&rsquo;t the final designs!</em></strong> We&rsquo;re just toying around with a few things in the wild so we can refine and adjust the designs and underlying code. This way, when the actual CMS driven site goes live we'll already have done real user testing on our actual audience (you).</p>
<p><small><i>Isn&rsquo;t that what we advise our clients to do?</i></small></p>
<h3>We Need Your Feedback!</h3>
<p>Anyway, go ahead and poke around the site. <a href="https://github.com/AWDG/awdg.org">Take a look under the hood</a>. Most importantly, tell us what you think about it. So <a href="http://twitter.com/awdg">tweet us</a>, <a href="mailto:jc@awdg.org">email me directly</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/AWDG/awdg.org/issues">create a GitHub issue</a>. Your feedback is really valuable to us, and to the project as a whole.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for now. Thanks for your support!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Here we are. This is the basis for our new website.</p>
<h3>Don&rsquo;t get excited. This is not the final design!</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something we put together to serve as a placeholder for updates and other info while the website is being made.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happening here? This is just a quick <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> website hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. We&rsquo;ve used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Twitter Bootstrap</a> to get things up and running quickly. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/AWDG/awdg.org">have a look at the code</a>.
<p>The <a href="/speak/">Speaker Application</a> and <a href="/sponsor/">Become a Sponsor</a> forms are powered by Wufoo, and the <a href="/join">Join the Group</a> form is hooked up to our Mailchimp account (which we&rsquo;ll use as the basis for our membership database).</p>


<h3>Wait a sec. Who&rsquo;s doing this?</h3>
<p>As we said in the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jcornelius/official-awdg-website">Kickstarter Campaign</a>, we&rsquo;re running this like a regular client project (except that we&rsquo;re posting a lot of details to the public), so the team at Nine Labs is leading the charge.</p>
<p>We have <a href="https://twitter.com/jc">J Cornelius</a> as Project Manager, <a href="https://twitter.com/suckerpunchinc">Brad Weaver</a> as UX and Creative Lead, <a href="https://twitter.com/mospired">Moses Ngone</a> as Technical Lead, and <a href="https://twitter.com/jottin">Jason Ottinger</a> as Design Lead.</p>
<p>Want to help out? Great! We&rsquo;ll certainly need help as things move along. <a href="mailto:jc@awdg.org">Send me an email</a> with your skills and what you&rsquo;d like to do to help.</p>

<h2>Sketching Things Out</h2>
<p>Here are a few sketches Brad has been working on showing various ideas for how the home page, events list, and profile page might lay out.</p>
